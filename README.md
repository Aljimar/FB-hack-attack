## About

Hack Attack is a website built for [Bitcamp 2017](http://bitca.mp/) (a hackathon at [UMD](https://www.umd.edu/)). It allows two players to challenge each other in programming puzzles designed to help them learn a specific language.  
During our limited time, we created functionality only for Python.
