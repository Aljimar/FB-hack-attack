## About

Forked from [Hack Attack](https://github.com/jackcogdill/hack-attack).  
Hack Attack is a website built for [Bitcamp 2017](http://bitca.mp/) (a hackathon at [UMD](https://www.umd.edu/)). It allows two players to challenge each other in programming puzzles designed to help them learn a specific language.  

This website was expanded on and improved for the "Facebook with Benefits" event hosted by Hackers@VT on May 2nd at Virginia Tech. We used a tournament style bracket and let over 95 participants compete in the cryptography and capture the flag challenges.
